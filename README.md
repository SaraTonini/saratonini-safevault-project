Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed, with Copilot Assistance
As part of the SafeVault Project, we conducted a thorough review of the application's security and identified critical vulnerabilities, including:

1. SQL Injection
Identified Problem: Queries in the code concatenated user input directly into SQL statements, which exposed the database to potential SQL injection attacks.

Solution Applied:

Replaced insecure concatenated strings in queries with parameterized statements using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.

Updated the DatabaseHelper.cs class to securely handle database queries.

How Copilot Assisted:

Suggested secure examples of parameterized queries.

Helped generate the DatabaseHelper.cs implementation.

Assisted in writing a robust unit test (SQLInjectionTests.cs) using the Moq library to simulate database behavior and validate protections against SQL injection attempts.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Identified Problem: Inputs from users were directly rendered in the frontend without proper sanitization, which could have allowed malicious scripts to execute.

Solution Applied:

Introduced a new utility class, InputSanitizer.cs, which uses HttpUtility.HtmlEncode to sanitize all user inputs before rendering.

Ensured all rendered user inputs were properly escaped, mitigating potential XSS vulnerabilities.

How Copilot Assisted:

Provided the idea and implementation for the sanitization function using HttpUtility.HtmlEncode.

Generated the XSSTests.cs file to simulate XSS attacks and verify that inputs are safely sanitized before rendering.

3. Debugging and Testing
Test Scenarios Created:

SQL Injection: Simulated malicious inputs such as '; DROP TABLE Users; -- to confirm the database remained secure.

XSS: Injected malicious scripts like <script>alert('Hacked!')</script> into user inputs and verified their sanitization.

How Copilot Assisted:

Assisted in setting up unit tests using the NUnit framework for both SQL injection and XSS scenarios.

Suggested using the Moq library to mock database interactions, enabling robust testing without a real database connection.

Summary
The integration of Copilot significantly streamlined the process of identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities. By leveraging Copilot's suggestions for secure coding practices, parameterized queries, input sanitization, and automated tests, we ensured that SafeVault is secure and resilient against common attacks such as SQL Injection and XSS. These efforts not only protected the application but also demonstrated how AI tools like Copilot can assist in creating safe and robust software.
