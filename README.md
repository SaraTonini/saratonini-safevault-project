## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed with Copilot Assistance

As part of the **SafeVault Project**, we conducted a thorough review of the application's security and resolved critical vulnerabilities. Below is a summary of the vulnerabilities identified, the fixes applied, and how Copilot assisted in the process.

### **1. SQL Injection**
- **Identified Problem**: 
  - Queries in the code concatenated user input directly into SQL statements, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Implemented **parameterized statements** in database queries using `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` to handle user inputs securely.
  - Refactored the `DatabaseHelper.cs` class to ensure all SQL queries are safe from injection vulnerabilities.
- **Copilot's Assistance**:
  - Suggested secure patterns for parameterized queries.
  - Helped implement the `DatabaseHelper.cs` class with examples of secure database interactions.
  - Assisted in creating the `SQLInjectionTests.cs` test file, which simulates malicious inputs and ensures the system blocks injection attempts effectively.

### **2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Identified Problem**:
  - User inputs were rendered directly in the frontend without being sanitized, leaving the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Introduced the `InputSanitizer.cs` utility class, which leverages `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` to sanitize user inputs and prevent script execution.
  - Verified that all user-generated content is properly escaped before rendering.
- **Copilot's Assistance**:
  - Suggested the use of `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` for sanitizing inputs.
  - Provided implementation guidance for `InputSanitizer.cs`.
  - Assisted in generating `XSSTests.cs`, which tests the sanitization process with simulated XSS attack inputs.

### **3. Debugging and Testing**
- **Test Scenarios Created**:
  - **SQL Injection**: Simulated malicious inputs like `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` to confirm the system rejects them and remains secure.
  - **XSS**: Injected harmful inputs like `<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>` and verified their proper encoding to prevent execution.
- **Copilot's Assistance**:
  - Helped set up unit tests using the `NUnit` framework to cover both SQL Injection and XSS scenarios.
  - Suggested using the `Moq` library to mock database interactions, enabling thorough testing without requiring a real database.

### **Summary**
The integration of **Copilot** proved invaluable during the development process. From identifying vulnerabilities to suggesting secure coding practices, Copilot streamlined the implementation of robust security measures. With the enhancements made, SafeVault is now resilient to common attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting, ensuring the safety and reliability of the application.
